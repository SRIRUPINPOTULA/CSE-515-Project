#Repo Directory Structure:

#1.Code Directory: 
##1.1 Task -1: In directory task-1, Task-1.ipynb file has been added which corresponds to the code and output for Task-1. In this python file itself, the outputs of the sample inputs have been printed.
##1.4 Task-4:  In directory task-1, Task-4.ipynb file was added which corresponds to the code that have used to generate the output for all the videos of target videos. The outputs are exported to json.
##1.5 Task-5:  In directory task-1, Task-5.ipynb file has been added that actually measures the 'm' similar videos for the video file given using the json of Task-4 and using the logic of Task-1.


#2. Output:
##2.1 Task-1 Output: In output directory, in directory 'Task-4' contains the output of the code that is made for task -1. Each of the json files represents the target actions. The mapping of them to the target videos are listed below:
Output of action type sword => 'sword_output.json'
Output of action type cartwheel => 'cartwheel_output.json'
Output of action type drink => 'drink_output.json'
Output of action type ride_bike => 'ridebikeoutput.json'
Output of action type sword_excercise => 'swordexercise_output.json'
