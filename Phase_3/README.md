## 1. Code:
This directory consists of all the tasks' codes, including preprocessing and actual tasks.

### Util:

KMeans.py: The python file contains the implementation for KMeans Dimensionality Reduction.

PCA.py: The python file contains the implementation for PCA.

SVD.py: The python file contains the implementation for SVD.

KMeanslatentmodel.py: The python file contains the implementation that gathers all the features of target video and used for calculation of latent models which are used for Task-1b.

services.py: This file contains common variables and functions to extract the latent model for Task 1a.

### Task-0a:

Task_0a.py: Task to find the inherent dimensionality of the feature spaces.

### Task-1:

Task_1_preprocess.py: Gets the thumbnails for all the videos.

Task_1a.py: Implementation of Spectral Clustering.

Task_1b.py: Implementation of KMeans Clustering.

### Task-2:

Task_2.py: Consists that code that implements `KNN` and `SVM` classifiers.

### Task-3:

Task_3a.py: Consists of code that implements LSH for the given input.

Task-3b_preprocess.py: Consists of code that saves the thumbnails for the videos.

Task_3b.py: Consists of code that implements LSH for all the videos

# Using the SQLite Database

1. Connect to the database from the CLI
> `sqlite3 database/Phase_3.db`

2. List the tables in the db
> `.tables`

3. View the table Schema
> `.schema data`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or

>`PRAGMA table_info(data)`

4. Use SQL to query db
> `select * from data limit 5;`
